# Bible Verse Generator

This project is designed to bring a bit of inspiration and encouragement by randomly selecting a hopeful Bible verse from a collection of 100 carefully curated verses stored in a JavaScript file.

## How It Works
The project imports a JavaScript file (`hopeful_verses.js`) exporting 100 Bible verses, each with a reference (e.g., "John 3:16") and the verse. Upon clicking the generate button, picks a random verse of the 100 to display.
