# Bible Verse Generator

This project is designed to bring a bit of inspiration and encouragement by randomly selecting a hopeful Bible verse from a collection of 100 carefully curated verses stored in a JSON file.

## How It Works
The project uses a JSON file (`hopeful_verses.json`) containing 100 Bible verses, each with a reference (e.g., "John 3:16") and the verse. Upon clicking the generate button, a script reads the file and picks a random verse to display.
